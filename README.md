# Ray Tracing Project

This project implements a simple ray tracing engine using the Python programming language. Ray tracing is a technique for rendering 3D images that simulates the behavior of light by tracing rays from the camera into the virtual scene.

## Features

The ray tracing engine supports the following features:

- **Sphere Intersection**: The engine can detect intersections between rays and spheres in the scene. The equation for ray-sphere intersection is given by:

  ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cinline%20%5Cbg_white%20%5Ctext%7Bray%7D%20%3D%20%5Ctext%7Borigin%7D%20+%20t%20%5Ccdot%20%5Ctext%7Bdirection%7D)

  Where `ray` is the intersection point, `origin` is the origin of the ray, `t` is the distance along the ray, and `direction` is the direction of the ray.

- **Shading**: The engine calculates the shading of objects based on the lighting in the scene. The shading equation combines the ambient, diffuse, and specular components to determine the final color of a pixel.

- **Reflection**: The engine supports reflection by recursively tracing reflected rays. The reflection equation is given by:

  ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cinline%20%5Cbg_white%20%5Ctext%7Breflected%7D%20%3D%20%5Ctext%7Bdirection%7D%20-%202%20%5Ccdot%20%5Ctext%7Bnormal%7D%20%5Ccdot%20%28%5Ctext%7Bdirection%7D%20%5Ccdot%20%5Ctext%7Bnormal%7D%29)

  Where `reflected` is the reflected ray direction, `direction` is the incident ray direction, and `normal` is the surface normal.

## Usage

To use the ray tracing engine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ray-tracing-project.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the ray tracing program:

   ```
   python ray_tracing.py
   ```

   This will generate an image based on the scene description specified in the `scene.json` file.
